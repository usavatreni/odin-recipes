    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic Italian dish that's one of my favories. Breaded chicken with pasta!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>1 tablespoon butter</li> 
           <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
           <li>1/3 cup minced onion</li>
           <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
           <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
           <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
           <li>1/3 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
           <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
           <li>3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
           <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
           <li>1 tablespoons freshley grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 2 minutes. 
                Pour in diced tomatoes and sugar. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for 10 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally. Once the sauce has simmered, stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for an additional 3 minutes. 
                Lower heat and keep sauce warm
            </li>
            <li>Stir together bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and dried oregano; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 2 tablespoons milk until blended. 
                Dip chicken breasts into the egg, then press into breadcrumb mixture to coat both sides, shaking off excess.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breasts and cook on both sides until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 
                and the bread crumb crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>To serve, spoon sauce over chicken and top with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Let stand a few minutes until the cheese has melted from the heat of the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
