  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Filet mignon with Gorgonzola sauce is a very simple and delicious meal for two. 
      A good sear on your steak will ensure a juicy, tender steak. 
      I have found this to be the best way to cook a steak indoors.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2(6 ounces) filet mignon steaks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Place a large, oven-proof skillet
                in the oven as it preheats.
            </li>
            <li>Bring steaks to room temp. Rub with olive oil and season generously
                with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the hot skillet from oven and place it on a burner set to high
                heat. Leave the oven on.
            </li>
            <li>Place steaks into the dry pan immediately and sear, turning with tongs,
                1 to 2 minutes on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the pan back into the preheated oven and cook until desired doneness is reached, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                For medium doneness, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). 
                Transfer steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes; the steaks will 
                continue to cook during this process and the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and saute until shallot is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Pour in cream; let cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. 
                Turn heat to low and add Gorgonzola cheese. Let cheese melt; season with salt and pepper. Serve sauce with steaks
            </li>
        </ol>
